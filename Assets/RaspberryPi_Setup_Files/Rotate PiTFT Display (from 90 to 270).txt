Make sure /boot/config.txt has the correct rotation setting for the PiTFT.

Open the file:

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Look for this section (added by adafruit-pitft.py):

# --- added by adafruit-pitft-helper ---
[pi4]
dtoverlay=pitft28-capacitive,rotate=270,speed=62000000,fps=60
[all]
...

If rotate=270 is not there or incorrect, set it to 270.

Then save (Ctrl+O, Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).
