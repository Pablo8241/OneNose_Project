Make sure the csv_collection script collect data in the following order:
The first three readings are from the BME680:
temp, pressure, humidity, gas resistance
Then we have readings from each of the 6 SGP30 sensors starting from sensor 5:
sgp30_5_co2, sgp30_5_tvoc, sgp30_6_co2, sgp30_6_tvoc... and so on until sgp30_10_co2, sgp30_10_tvoc


Deploy machine-learning algorithm as a .eim file:
Go to deployment options and choose "Linux (ARMv7)". Also make sure the target device is Raspberry Pi 4.
Then Build and download the generated .eim file.
Place the .eim file in the same directory as 'Enose_Program.py'.
